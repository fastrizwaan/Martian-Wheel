# Martian-Wheel icon theme
(C) GPL3 -  Mohammed Asif Ali Rizvan <fast.rizwaan@gmail.com>

Designed for Gnome shell on Fedora 31 Workstation. 

I have designed these icons using inspiration from my old Klassic Icon theme and Paper icon theme and Boston icon theme and using some of the Martian Colour Wheel colors. The icons are stock hicolor icons i.e., the original application icon is slightly modified to make it flatter. Any hints or suggestion please use github issue.

Most Icon themes does not include meaningful icons for ROMs like NES, SNES, etc. I've used Cartridge as icon for the ROM and full console as rom icon for the handhelds.

Martian wheel Icons have simple radial and diagonal gradients and 2-3 colors and minimal appearance.

The Icons are designed at 128 pixels, All of the SVGs are editable. I have chosen GPL3 license for these Icons, some icons are from svgrepo.com with CC 4.0 which can be one way relicensed to GPL3.

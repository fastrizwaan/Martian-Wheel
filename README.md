# Martian-Wheel icon theme
(C) GPL3 -  Mohammed Asif Ali Rizvan <fast.rizwaan@gmail.com>

Designed for Gnome shell. 

I was Not Satisfied with Adwaita icon theme, especially the mimetypes have almost invisible border. The mimetypes also do not look that consistent like that of application icons. Hence I have designed using inspiration from my old Klassic Icon theme and Paper icon theme and Boston icon theme and using some of the Martian Wheel colors.

Most Icon theme does not include meaningful icons for ROMs like NES, SNES, etc. I've used Cartridge as icon for the ROM and full console as rom icon for the handhelds.

Martian wheel Icons have simple radial and diagonal gradients and 2-3 colors and minimal appearance. It took me 3 months to come up with these icons which will be updated sooner for other desktops like KDE, elementary.

The Icons are designed at 128 pixels, All of the SVGs are editable. I have chosen GPL3 license for these Icons, There are some CC 4.0 icons which can be one-way licensed to GPL3.
